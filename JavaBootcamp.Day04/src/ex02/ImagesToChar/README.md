## Getting Started

Welcome. Here is a guideline to help you get started with ImagesToChar project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains one folder by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `target` folder by default.

## Compiling

Ð¡ompilation is done by running `build.sh` file. Make sure to give a permission for execution to it by running `sudo chmod +x build.sh`.
Then to compile the project use command `./build.sh` in ImagesToChar main folder. `build.sh` also provides instructions to create a JAR-file,
which u can find in `target` folder after compiling. 

## Executing

`java -jar images-to-char-printer.jar --white [COLOR_1] --black [COLOR_2]`, where:
- COLOR_1 - is a color to represent pixels without color component,
